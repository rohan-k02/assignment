# Release Notes / Changelog

## New Features
* **Beelzebub** (SSH) and **Galah** (HTTP) are the first LLM-based honeypots included in T-Pot (requires Ollama installation or a ChatGPT subscription).
* **Go-Pot** a HTTP tarpit designed to maximize bot misery by slowly feeding them an infinite stream of fake secrets.
* **Honeyaml** a configurable API server honeypot even supporting JWT-based HTTP bearer/token authentication.
* **H0neytr4p** a HTTP/S honeypot capable of emulating vulnerabilities using configurable traps.
* **Miniprint** a medium-interaction printer honeypot.

## Updates

* **Elastic Stack** has been upgrade to 8.16.1.
* **Cyberchef** has been updated to the latest release.
* **Elasticvue** has been updated to 1.1.0.
* **Suricata** has been updated to 7.0.7, now supporting JA4 hashes.

## Breaking Changes  
### NGINX  
- The container no longer runs in host mode, requiring changes to the `docker-compose.yml` and related services.  
- To avoid confusion and downtime, the `24.04.1` tag for Docker images has been introduced.  
- **Important**: Actively update T-Pot as described in the [README](https://github.com/telekom-security/tpotce/blob/master/README.md).  
- **Deprecation Notice**: The `24.04` tagged images will no longer be maintained and will be removed by **2025-01-31**.  

### Suricata  
- Capture filters have been updated to exclude broadcast, multicast, NetBIOS, IGMP, and MDNS traffic.
